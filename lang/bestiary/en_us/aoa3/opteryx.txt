A large avian creature that has the characteristics of both a bird and a reptile.
It sports large primary claws and talons, but they seem to be used mostly for gripping tall structures as they're a particularly timid animal.

Despite being timid, they are primarily carnivorous, and subsist almost exclusively on the flesh of prey.

Its deceptively strong wings enable it to take flight at will, even when carrying a substantial amount of weight.

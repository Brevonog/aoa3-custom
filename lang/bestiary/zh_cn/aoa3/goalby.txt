Surprisingly lightweight creatures, Goalbies are actually a species from the Haven dimension. They originally came to the overworld during the last great dimension clash, in which several species from a number of dimensions were leaked across their borders.
它们巨大的翅膀状部位分泌出很容易脱落的微小孢子。这些孢子会在接触到现存大多数物种时会造成暂时性的肌肉虚弱和疲劳。 When they come in contact, these spores cause temporary muscle weakness and fatigue to most living species.

Like most Haven creatures, Goalbies are aggressive, and will attempt to attack even when unprovoked.

The Amphibior is an aggressive bipedal creature from L'Borean that appears to be a resident of the aquatic castles.
它们身体上的毛孔似乎可以渗出水来，可以明显注意到它们富含水分的珊瑚状结构。由于半浸在水中时它们似乎可以快速地通过水分来愈合伤口，所以可以猜测这种身体结构是一种便于进行有丝分裂的形态。 It's suspected that this is used as a form of mitosis, as when semi-submerged, they appear to heal wounds very quickly from the water.

它们攻击目标时，会迅速排出体内的水分，并在脚下形成一个个水塘。

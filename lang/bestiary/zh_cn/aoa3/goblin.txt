Goblins are generally considered a pest by most landowners and explorers, and are generally mostly well known for their destructive, provocative tendencies.
While technically a humanoid, Goblins are entirely unrelated to the human species, and evolved separately. Regardless of this, they have evolved some sort of primitive intellect, and are able to communicate with each other.

哥布林的智力有限，因而他们被认为是极具攻击性的，不过好在它们几乎不持有武器且没有明显的攻击特征，这使得它们并非是那么危险。

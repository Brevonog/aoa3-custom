King chargers are much like normal chargers, with the exception that they're significantly larger, wear a crown, and rule the roost.
对于任何人来说都要想尽方法避免与袭击者之王相遇，因为它们增强的耐力，力量和速度足以让毫无防备的冒险家受到挑战。

Their natural Charger instincts are present, and they will attack in much the same way normal charges will, however their added strength is enough to temporarily weaken anything it manages to land a successful blow on.
Additionally, a threat to them is considered a threat to the nest, and so it won't take long for nearby Chargers to show themselves and aid their king.

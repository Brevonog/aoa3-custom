Slow, brutish, and seemingly unintelligent, Sasquatches are a commonly seen creature that roams throughout forests and woodlands. Their slow movement is handily balanced by their physical strength, and taking one on physically may prove a challenge.

They have trouble recognising friend from foe, and have been known to attack humans because of this. Be aware of their presence and avoid if possible.
Additionally, though they seem to lack intelligence, they have been known to carry primitive tools from time to time - however not much is known as to why.

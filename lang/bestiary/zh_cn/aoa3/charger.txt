One of the most adaptable birds in the overworld. Chargers are a known pest species of large flightless birds that seem intent on flocking towards potential attackers with no regard for safety.
它们的长腿和灵活的身体使它们在陆地上奔跑时具有很高的速度和机动性，甚至击败了一些快速的四足动物。不过值得庆幸的是，他们的移动能力很容易被他们固有的脆弱性所抵消。如果遇到这样的敌人，用几次精准的攻击来消灭它并不太难。
The good news is that their mobile prowess is easily offset by their inherent fragility. If confronted by one, it's usually not too hard to dispatch with a few well-aimed hits.

尽管如此，仍然值得警惕，因为它们的高速和锋利的喙可以迅速压倒毫无戒心的受害者。

电弧花实际上是一种利用地面来躲避捕食者的电弧蠕虫。电弧蠕虫的头部已经“机智地”进化出一种形似于附近植被的增生物，然后把自己埋在地下，依靠振动来寻找猎物。 Cleverly, the arcworm has evolved a growth on its head that looks very similar to nearby flora. It then buries itself underground and relies on vibrations to find prey.
当它感觉到它自己成为了目标时，它会立即停止运动，直到感觉安全后再移动。

When not staying still, it will sneak up on prey and attempt to eat them feet-first. Unfortunately it doesn't seem capable of determining whether a target is small enough to actually be eaten before attempting to do so.

如果电弧蠕虫被反击，它会立即钻出地面并开始攻击。

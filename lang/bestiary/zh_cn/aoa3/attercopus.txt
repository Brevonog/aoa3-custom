Small, arachnid creatures that are primarily found in caves and the underground. They have no issue identifying threats in the dark due to their trained set of eyes.
相当大的毒刺是它们主要的攻击媒介——有点像蝎子——可以快速地给目标注射挥之不去的毒素。

They are normally found in small groups and packs, and can quickly overwhelm their victims.

尽管它们主要在地下被发现，它们也会在夜间出现在沙漠地表，可能是挖出一条路来寻找更多的食物。

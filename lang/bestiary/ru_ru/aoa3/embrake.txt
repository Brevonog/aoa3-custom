This volcanic lizard is a native to the Nether, thriving in its molten shores.
Its hard scales and reinforced skin offer excellent heat-resistance leaving it almost entirely unharmed by the intense temperatures of its home.

As if to further prove its harmony with the fires of the Nether, its primary method of both offense and defense is to breath out a steady stream of particularly intense flames.

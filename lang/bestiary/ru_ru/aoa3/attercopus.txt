Small, arachnid creatures that are primarily found in caves and the underground. They have no issue identifying threats in the dark due to their trained set of eyes.
Their rather large stinger is its primary attack vector, acting somewhat like a scorpion in quickly dosing its target with a lingering poison.

They are normally found in small groups and packs, and can quickly overwhelm their victims.

Despite mainly being found underground, they have been found on the surface of the desert at night, presumably as they dig their way out looking for more to eat.

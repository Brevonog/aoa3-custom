Flamewalkers are aggressive, tormented beings that are more of an elemental than a living creature.
Its skin is molten to the touch, proving far too hot for most creatures to approach - not that anything should be approaching it to begin with.

It uses its mastery of heat to generate flame geysers under the feet of its targets, imbuing the flames with small amounts of magic to inflict nasty magical burns and torching its victims.
On their own, their slow attack is usually somewhat harmless as long as the victim isn't caught unaware.
The real danger occurs when encountered in its commonly-occurring small groups, where the compounded flames offer serious danger to anything they set their targets on.

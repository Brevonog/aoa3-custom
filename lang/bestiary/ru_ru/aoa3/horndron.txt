A large, bulky, cattle-like creature, Horndrons are rough looking animals that are known for their ability to survive in the harsh wilds of Precasia despite being open prey for other, more aggressive creatures.

They tend to roam in packs, and it's not uncommon to find young calves plodding along beside them.
They seem particular to Calab Grass, often chasing after it when presented to them even to the detriment of their safety.

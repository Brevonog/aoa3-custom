Calmly roaming the Precasian lands, these quadrupedal animals love nothing more than to live a peaceful life and eat some leaves.
They tend to be found in packs, occasionally with young offspring staying close.

Despite their large size and sturdy frame, they are skittish creatures that often resort to fleeing or just outright panicking when threatened.

They are particularly fond of Lucalus Leaves, seeking them out to eat quite frequently.

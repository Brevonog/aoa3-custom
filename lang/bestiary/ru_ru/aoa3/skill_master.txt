An enigmatic being, the Skill Master can be found throughout the various planes of existence, seemingly wandering with little to no goals or intentions.

He will sell skill-related items if asked, but will not communicate with anyone, verbally or non-verbally.
It is unclear where it came from, or even what species it is, but its presence throughout the realms does raise numerous questions.

One thing is known for sure however - despite being seemingly part of a group of like-minded individuals, the Skill Master is a single entity, and is inexplicably capable of projecting itself in multiple locations at once, even within the same line of sight.
No-one is sure how this is possible, or why it does so, but previous encounters with the individual have shown this to be the case.
